        <h1>Timothy Magno</h1>
        <p>Greetings! I am an aspiring full-stack developer currently learning the 
          fundamentals of front-end development to kick-start my developer journey. 
          Although I do not possess the creativity for UI/UX design, my passion lies in 
          having the scrupulousness and determination to pro  duce correct and satisfactory 
          results, as well as to perfectly and cleanly materialize the designer's vision of 
          the product. Still, passion and perseverance can only take me part of the way 
          without the relevant experiences, which is why I am also open to being trained. 
          If you are interested, let's talk!
