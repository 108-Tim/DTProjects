          <h1>Timothy Magno</h1>
          <p>Greetings! I am an aspiring full-stack developer currently learning the 
            fundamentals of front-end development to kick-start my developer journey. 
            Although I do not possess the creativity for UI/UX design, my passion lies in 
            having the scrupulousness and determination to produce correct and satisfactory 
            results, as well as to perfectly and cleanly materialize the designer's vision of 
            the product. Still, passion and perseverance can only take me part of the way 
            without the relevant experiences, which is why I am also open to being trained. 
            If you are interested, let's talk!

            <h3>Alumni Details Form</h3>
            <p>A form-answering webpage to keep track of Alumni credentials. After 
              submission, respondents receive unique IDs that they can use to update 
              their credentials. Cloud Firestore Database houses the data collected 
              and is exclusively accessible by the department's admin. The admin is 
              capable of editing and deleting entries, but only with the owner's 
              consent. Additionally, they can query existing entries for purposes such 
              as data analysis and back up the database into a Google Sheets file for 
              safekeeping. Firebase Authentication handles the admin's login logistics.
